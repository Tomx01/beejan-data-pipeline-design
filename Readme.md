# 📘 Data Pipeline Design for Beejan Technologies

## 📖 Project Overview  
Beejan Technologies receives thousands of daily customer complaints across different channels such as social media, call centers, SMS, and website forms.  

Currently, data is stored in multiple formats, reports are manually compiled, and teams work in silos — resulting in delays and inefficiencies.  

This project presents a **conceptual design of an end-to-end data pipeline** that unifies, cleans, enriches, and organizes complaint data to make it ready for analysis, reporting, and decision-making.

## 🛠️ Conceptual Pipeline Design  

The pipeline is designed in **seven key stages**:

1. **Source Identification**  
   - Complaints arrive from multiple channels:  
     - Social Media (real-time streaming)  
     - Call Center Logs (batch)  
     - SMS Records (batch)  
     - Website Forms (batch)  

2. **Ingestion Strategy**  
   - APIs, log files, and streaming feeds are used depending on the channel.  
   - Real-time social media data (e.g., Twitter) is captured continuously.  

3. **Processing & Transformation**  
   - Raw data is cleaned, standardized, and enriched.  
   - Complaints are categorized (e.g., network issues, billing errors, customer service).  

4. **Storage Options**  
   - **Data Lake** → stores raw, unprocessed data.  
   - **Data Warehouse** → stores cleaned, structured data for analysis and reporting.  

5. **Serving Layer**  
   - Data is made available via:  
     - **Dashboards & KPIs** for managers.  
     - **Ad-hoc Queries** for analysts.  
     - **Alerts & Notifications** for urgent cases.  

6. **Orchestration & Monitoring**  
   - Pipelines run on both schedules and event triggers.  
   - Failures are logged and alerts are sent automatically.  

7. **DataOps**  
   - Designed for production readiness.  
   - Scalable to handle large complaint volumes daily.

## ✅ Assumptions  

- Social media complaints are treated as real-time streaming data.  
- Call center logs, SMS, and website forms are ingested as batch data.  
- The company has infrastructure to store both raw and processed data.  
- Complaint categories are predefined (network, billing, customer service, etc.).  
- Alerts are required only for urgent complaints (e.g., outages, repeated billing errors).  
- Reporting team uses dashboards, while analysts need direct query access.  

---

## 🎯 Challenges / Unknowns  

- The exact **data volume** is unspecified, which may impact scalability.  
- Accuracy of **complaint classification** depends on data quality.  
- Real-time **social media monitoring** may require advanced filtering to reduce noise.  

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes  

- A **unified data pipeline** connecting all complaint sources.  
- **Automated reporting**, reducing reliance on manual spreadsheets.  
- Actionable insights delivered via dashboards, alerts, and queries.  
- Improved decision-making and faster response to customer issues.

## 🚀 Next Steps  

- Extend the conceptual design with **technology-specific choices** (e.g., Kafka, Spark, Snowflake).  
- Prototype ingestion and transformation on a sample dataset.  
- Deploy a minimal version of the pipeline for testing.
